# UBC Salaries

The University of British Columbia (UBC) is required to produce a Statement of Financial Information (SOFI) each year. This document contains the compensation of all employees making more than $75,000. This project is about putting that data into an easily searchable format. 

The original data can be found [here](https://finance.ubc.ca/reporting-planning-analysis/reports-and-disclosures).
